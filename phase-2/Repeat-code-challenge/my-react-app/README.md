### **4. Bonus Features**
To implement the bonus features (edit, delete, and highlight search terms), you can extend the existing code:

1. **Edit Books**:
   - Add an "Edit" button to each book.
   - Create a form to update the book details.

2. **Delete Books**:
   - Add a "Delete" button to each book.
   - Use the `filter` method to remove the book from the list.

3. **Highlight Search Terms**:
   - Use `replace` and regular expressions to wrap the search term in a `<span>` with a highlight class.
